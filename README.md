# USACO Solutions in Java

This repository is for storing my practice solutions for USACO contests. I'm currently in Rank Silver. Note: for problems around and before 2013, "bronze" is equivalent to current "silver."

## Where to find the problems

Most problems could be found on the [USACO website](http://www.usaco.org/index.php?page=contests). Earlier problems could be found on the [PKU JudgeOnline](http://poj.org/).

## Naming conventions

USACO hosts four online contests each year, one in March, one in December, one in January, and one in February. For each contest, there would be three problems, namely Problem 1, Problem 2, and Problem 3.

The folder for each contest would be named as "YYYYMM_Rank," where "Rank" would most likely be "Silver" as for now. In the folder of each contest, there would be three folders named "Problem 1," "Problem 2," and "Problem 3." Each folder would then contain the project containing the solution.
