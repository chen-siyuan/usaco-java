# USACO Solutions in Java

This repository is for storing my practice solutions for USACO contests. I'm currently in Rank Silver.

## Where to find the problems

Most problems could be found on the [USACO website](http://www.usaco.org/index.php?page=contests). Earlier problems could be found on the [PKU JudgeOnline](http://poj.org/).

## Naming conventions

USACO hosts four online contests each year, one in March, one in December, one in January, and one in February. For each contest, there would be three problems, namely Problem 1, Problem 2, and Problem 3.

The folder for each contest would be named as "YYYYMM_Rank," where "Rank" would most likely be "Silver" as for now (Some earlier problems might be in "Bronze" as "Bronze" before the rank adjustment in 2016 is equivalent to current "Silver"). In the folder of each contest, there would be three folders named "Problem 1," "Problem 2," and "Problem 3." Each folder would then contain the project containing the solution.

## Validating solutions

For the majority of the problems, you can validate my solution (or your own) on the USACO website. Some earlier problems, however, do not allow further submissions. I would recommend going to PKU JudgeOnline or some other websites to find the problem and try testing the solution there.

I am also currently working on a local validation system.
